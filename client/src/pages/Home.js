        When you're about to toss out that aluminum can into the recycling bin, ever felt a doubt that you're misorganizing your trash? 
        According to the Environmental Protection Agency, just in 2018 alone, 292.4 million tons of municipal solid waste is generated. Of those,
        146.1 tons ended up in landfills. You can help flatten that curve with the click of a button! Our app identifies your trash and gives you
        the proper bin to dispose of it.
